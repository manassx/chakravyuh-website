## About The Project

This project is a complete, visually appealing website designed to provide information and attract participants for a MUN conference. The goal was to create a professional and engaging user experience using only foundational web technologies, with a strong focus on responsive design and modern CSS practices.

## Features

* **Fully Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Interactive Full-Screen Navigation:** A clean, overlay menu for an immersive user experience.
* **Modern UI with Animations:** Subtle animations and hover effects create a dynamic feel.
* **Semantic & Accessible HTML:** Built with modern HTML5 tags for better structure and accessibility.

## Tech Stack

This project was built from the ground up using only core web technologies.

* **HTML5:** For the document structure.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and animations.
    * **Flexbox** for responsive alignment.
    * **Relative Units (`rem`)** for scalable typography and spacing.
    * **CSS Keyframe Animations** for the preloader and menu transitions.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, including DOM manipulation and event handling for the navigation menu.

## What I Learned

This project was a fantastic opportunity to solidify my understanding of frontend fundamentals. Key takeaways include:

* The importance of a **mobile-first** approach to CSS.
* Advanced DOM manipulation to create interactive elements like a custom menu.
* Refactoring code to use semantic HTML and relative CSS units (`rem`) for better scalability and maintainability.
* The process of deploying a static website to a hosting platform like Netlify.
